# Voxelz 

Voxelz - a hyperdimensional voxel array of elementals as part of a fluid, fractal and holographic framework. Voxelz have projections of Z axis encompassing the 3-dimensional equivalents of themselves as flowcycles, interacting dynamically as they communicate with definitions and engagements, producing thoughtforms.
